# RPG-life Application
**A gamified approach to personal development. Level up your skills, track your progress, and stay motivated—just like in an RPG!**



**About the Project:**


RPG-Life is a Python application designed to make self-improvement more engaging by turning it into an RPG-style game. Users can create an account, add and level up skills, track streaks, and earn achievements—all while enjoying a gamified experience.


The project started as a way to enhance my coding skills while tackling the challenge of motivating personal growth. It combines programming creativity with a real-world application that can help people stay on track with their goals.



**Features:**


Secure Login System: Accounts use hashed and salted passwords for enhanced security.

Skill Tracking: Add custom skills and gain experience by completing real-world tasks.

Dynamic Leveling System: Experience requirements increase by 1.2x for each level up, simulating in-game progression.

Visual Feedback: Avatars change as users level up, offering a rewarding sense of growth.

Efficient Data Retrieval: User data is stored in a hash map for scalability and performance.



**Technologies Used:**


Python: Core language for building application logic.

Tkinter: Used for designing the user interface.

Hashing: Securely storing and checking passwords.

Data Structures: Hash maps for efficient data management.



**Current Development Status:**


This project is currently under development. Major components such as the login system, skill tracking, and level-up logic are being implemented and tested. New features are continually being added to enhance the user experience.


 
**Future Features:**


Streak Tracking: Motivate users to stay consistent with daily goals.

Achievement System: Unlock rewards for milestones like leveling up skills or maintaining streaks.

Customizable Avatars: Let users personalize their profiles.

Data Visualization: Add graphs or progress bars to showcase skill development over time.
